"this" key = works will point

Closure is a feature that keeps reference to outter variables, even if the function is no longer on the execution stack.
close in all the variables it's supposed to have access to.

the prototype is just a reference to another object that have other properties.
every function has a property call "prototype" that starts as a empty object,
but if the "new" operator is use to invoke the function. it will be initiated.

the __proto__ is the prototype property of the function, but
the "prototype" is the property is inizialize when the function is use as
a construtor function to set the __proto__ of the objects created
with the constructor function.
